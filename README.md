DBMS PROJECT

MOVIE TICKET BOOKING database is designed using MYSQL. As many people opt to book tickets in advance
through online mode the demand for online ticket booking services has increased. So it is necessary
to manage the data of the customers who book tickets. In this project we created a ticket booking
database that manages various customer details like their name, mobile,ticket numbers, payment id, etc.
ER DIAGRAM and RELATIONAL MODEL were designed. Normalized the database to BCNF form i.e, upto
maximum extent to avoid data redundancy and reduce space wastage.
