# Movie_Ticket_Booking_Database<br/>
DBMS PROJECT <br />
<br/>
MOVIE TICKET BOOKING database is designed using MYSQL. As many people opt to book tickets in advance <br/>
through online mode the demand for online ticket booking services has increased. So it is necessary <br/>
to manage the data of the customers who book tickets. In this project we created a ticket booking <br/> 
database that manages various customer details like their name, mobile,ticket numbers, payment id, etc.<br/>
ER DIAGRAM and RELATIONAL MODEL were designed. Normalized the database to BCNF form i.e, upto <br/> 
maximum extent to avoid data redundancy and reduce space wastage.<br/>
